        <h1>THE BRAND</h1>
        <p>Redefining sportswear with a timeless, minimalist approach.</p>
        <p>Cole Buxton was born from a personal need for gym wear that wasn’t loud or overly branded but grounded in simplicity, quality, and authenticity. Inspired by the aesthetics of vintage athletic wear—think iconic looks from the likes of Schwarzenegger and Balboa—we've created pieces that combine the durability of traditional sportswear with a refined, understated elegance.</p>
        <p>Each Cole Buxton garment is designed to be versatile and crafted to last, from heavyweight cotton hoodies to essentials like our signature t-shirts and sweats. We believe in the power of minimalism to create clothing that endures beyond trends, resonating with those who appreciate clean lines, muted tones, and finely tuned details. Our commitment to quality and craftsmanship is evident in every stitch, ensuring our pieces feel as good as they look, from the gym to the street.</p>
