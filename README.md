# About this project

This is an attempt to build a replica of the Cole Buxton online store which I am a fan of (not finished yet).

The project here represents the frontend part built with React and makes use of technologies such as:
- GSAP for smooth animations.
- Redux to manage the app's state, for example, the shopping cart.
- React Router to navigate across the app.
- Apollo Client and GraphQL to execute queriest and mutations such as fetching products, colors, sizes, adding products to the cart, updating the items in the cart, deleting items from the cart, etc.

**DISCLAIMER: THE PROJECT WAS BUILT ONLY FOR LEARNING PURPOSES AND IT IS NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, GOING TO BE USED FOR COMMERCIAL USE.**
